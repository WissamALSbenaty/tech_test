This is a summary for the test , 

The project works on 3.27.1 sdk 

I built the project based on clean archtecture , i made sure it match the standerd architecture , 
I wish i had more time to remove the boilprate code from blocs , i could have done also more tests ,and enhance ui 
i usally abstract the blocs in way to keep error handling in a abstract bloc and all other are inheriting from it 

All errors are extended from CustomError , for any reasons an exception raised , it will be catched to somethingWentError class
